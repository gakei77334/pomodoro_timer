# Pomodoro Timer

This Python script creates a Pomodoro timer using the Tkinter library. The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that uses a timer to break work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.

**Key Features:**
* **Timer Mechanism:** Tracks work intervals of 25 minutes, short breaks of 5 minutes, and long breaks of 30 minutes after every 8th work interval.
* **Countdown Mechanism:** Displays countdown timers in minutes and seconds format.
* **User Interface (UI):** Uses Tkinter for building the graphical user interface (GUI).
* **Reset Functionality:** Allows users to reset the timer and clear session marks.

**Technologies Used:**
* Python
* Tkinter

**Timer Behavior:**
* **Work Interval:** Begins with a 25-minute work session, followed by a 5-minute short break after every completed work session.
* **Long Break:** After completing 8 work sessions, a 30-minute long break is initiated.
* **Continuous Loop:** The timer restarts after each interval, counting and displaying the number of completed work sessions with checkmarks.

**User Interface:**
* **Timer Display:** Shows the current countdown time in a large font.
* **Buttons:** Start initiates the timer, Reset clears the timer and session count.
* **Session Count:** Displays checkmarks for completed work sessions.

This application helps users manage time effectively by promoting focused work intervals followed by rejuvenating breaks, enhancing productivity and concentration.
